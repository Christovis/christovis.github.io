[FluTE](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000656&type=printable) is a agent-based model to simulate the spread of a influence epidemic. Together with Prof. Richard Bower, I adopted and enhanced the code base to be applied to the UK and with new physical mitigation policies. We presented the result at the Durham Institute for Data Science Friday's seminar.
