Together with Yu-Shan, I presented our work on Digital Platforms for Political Participation (DPPP) for representatives of the Hiroshima prefecture and Re:plic (Tokyo). Japan is increasingly interested in performing their own trials of DPPPs and were therefore eager to hear the insights we gained from our mixed methods study of [OmaStadi](https://omastadi.hel.fi) in Helsinki.
