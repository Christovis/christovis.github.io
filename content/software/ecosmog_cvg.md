A open-source N-body simulation code for dark-matter only cosmological structure formation for cubic vector Galileon model of the generalised Proca theory (GP) gravity theory. It is implemented in a modified version of the ECOSMOG which is based on RAMSES. It uses adaptive mesh refinement and adaptive time integration to simulate self-gravitating fluids and is massively parallelizable as it makes use of the MPI communication library.
