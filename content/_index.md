    <h1 class="homepage-hero-title">Hi! I'am Christoph Becker,</h1>
</div>

a researcher focusing on how matter flows through social-technical arrangements of waste management infrastructures. My work is driven by questions such as: Who makes what claims about un-, mis-, or managed wastes? What is the basis of a claim and how does it relate to others? In the light of multiple contesting claims, what remains knowable about wastes? I have contributed to Belgium and European research projects and given policy advice on, inter alia, waste diversion from incineration, marine litter, and the potentials of reuse and recycling in renewable energy systems.
I am a member of the [Working Group on Recycling and Waste Minimisation (WGRWM)](https://www.iswa.org/recycling-and-waste-minimisation/?v=d3dcf429c679")
of the [International Solid Waste Association (ISWA)](https://www.iswa.org/").

### Previously
Previously, I was a PostDoc at the [Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics](ttps://ibed.uva.nl/) and the [Institute for Advanced Study](https://ias.uva.nl/) where I develop modelling methodologies for analysing complex systems and help to set up the [POLDER Center](https://polder.center/) for policy decision-support. I obtained my [PhD](https://etheses.dur.ac.uk/14239/) in Astrophysics at the University of Durham with the support of the STFC/CDT scholarship.
